# freeCodeCamp_DrumPad_Project
Created with CodeSandbox by Adastros

This is one of five front library projects from freeCodeCamp.

This project was built using React and React-Bootstrap libraries.

This drumpad project utilizes the audio provided in one of freeCodeCamp's example project and soundclips from some anime shows. It has a volume slider, a bank slider (to change type
of audio played), a power button, a display, and drumpads. 

The drumpad does not change size on the viewport (for now).
